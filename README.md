# Topfschlagen ðŸ¥˜ðŸ¥„

An implementation of the famous German children's game "Topfschlagen" with **Vue.js**.

### Game Mode

A pot gets randomly placed in the viewport. You have to find it by hitting somewhere in the viewport - blindfolded. You get a hint for every hit, whether you got nearer or farer. "WÃ¤rmer" or "KÃ¤lter", as we say in Germany.
