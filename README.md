# Topfschlagen ðŸ¥˜ðŸ¥„

A virtual implementation of the famous German children's game "Topfschlagen" with **Vue.js** and **Greensock's TimelineLite** for animations. You can compare Topfschlagen with hitting a piÃ±ata, but it's a little different: You try to find a flipped over pot filled with candy by moving on the knees blindfolded and while hitting with a cooking spoon on the ground. All the other people in the room yell whether you got closer or farer - "hotter" or "colder". You succeed when you hear the loud noise as you finally hit the pot.

### Game mode

A pot gets randomly placed in the viewport. You have to find it by hitting somewhere in the viewport. You get a hint for every hit, whether you got nearer or farer. "WÃ¤rmer" or "KÃ¤lter", as we say in Germany.
